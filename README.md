## Convolution 

It is a process of multiplying two arrays of different length. These arrays are generally input pixels and kernel-filters.


## Filters/Kernels

 Kernel is a multidimensional array which is used to extract particular features from an input image. This is done by multiplying kernel-filters with image pixels.


## epochs

The number of times the CNN model sees the training data is termed as epochs. More number of epochs may result in over fitting  


## 1x1 Convolution

It is responsible for extracting every pixel in the channel. It is not doing convolution. It is just multiplying with each pixel.  It is used to reduce the number of channels.

## 3x3 Convolution

It has small receptive field and local and most complex features are extracted easily. 
It helps in deliberate reduction of image dimensions and make network deep.


## feature map

This is the output generated after applying kernel-filter to input/previous layer. All neurons are activated and output is a feature map.

## Activation Function

In CNN, activation function is responsible for deciding to activate a particular neuron or not in input. These are nonlinear transformations. 
 
## Receptive field

The number of input pixels the kernal’s pixel is looking at. There are 2 type of receptive field. Local receptive field and global receptive field.
